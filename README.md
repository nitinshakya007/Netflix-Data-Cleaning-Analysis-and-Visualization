# Netflix-Data-Cleaning-Analysis-and-Visualization

This project involves loading, cleaning, analyzing, and visualizing data from a Netflix dataset. We'll use Python libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to work through the project. The goal is to explore the dataset, derive insights, and prepare for potential machine learning tasks.

About Dataset:

The data consist of contents added to Netflix from 2008 to 2021. The oldest content is as old as 1925 and the newest as 2021. This dataset will be cleaned with PostgreSQL and visualized with Tableau. The purpose of this dataset is to test my data cleaning and visualization skills.
